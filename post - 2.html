                    <h2 class="section-heading">The INTERNET
                    <p>The seed of the internet was planted by Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider (was a professor at MIT) in early 1960s. He introduced the concept of ‘Intergalactic Computer Network’ which covered all the important aspects of internet as we know today.</p>
                    <p>The first ever communication between two computers was done with the help of ARPANET on October 29, 1969. The first message on ARPANET was sent through a host computer at UCLA to another computer at Stanford. And the message was “LOGIN”. But on the first trial, the system could only send two letters (L and O) before the system ‘crashed‘. On the second attempt, they were successful in transmitting the word ‘LOGIN’.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">World Wide Web</h2>
                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <blockquote
                        class="blockquote">
                        <p class="mb-0">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>
                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you
                            touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p><a href="#"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/post-sample-image.jpg"></a><span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>
                        <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
                        <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
